# Landslide-detection-with-satellite-imagery-using-deep-learning-UNet-Model

Landslides are a significant natural hazard that can cause severe environmental and economic damage. This project applies deep learning techniques, particularly a UNet-based segmentation model, to detect landslides in satellite images.
The model is trained on satellite imagery, where input images represent landscapes, and ground truth masks indicate landslide-affected areas. The UNet architecture is employed for pixel-wise classification to accurately delineate landslides.
The dataset for the project has been acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tekbahadurkshetri/landslide4sense
